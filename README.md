# NXESObfuscator

basic obfuscator for assemblies
- Made in .NET 3.1
- Good for small programs

Obfuscation of an assembly can make it even harder for someone to reverse engineer.

# Usage
To use this app, simply drag in a .dll file and select a obfuscation level.
Whenever obfuscation is finished, the app will output a fill named "YOUR_ASSEMBLY-obfuscated.dll".
